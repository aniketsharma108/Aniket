### **Special Features**:
1. **Typing Animation** - I will add this effect in the GitHub profile with a typing effect on introduction.
2. **GitHub Stats** - Shows your coding activity and highlights the most important info.
3. **Contribution Graph** - Shows your active contributions on GitHub, giving it a professional edge.

---

### How to Use:
- **Copy-paste this Markdown** into your GitHub repository **README.md**.
- For the **typing animation**, this can be set up using a small JavaScript snippet on your webpage, but GitHub itself doesn’t support dynamic scripts directly in the profile README. I can give you more specific guidance on how to add this to a personal website if you want.

---

If you'd like **additional animations or a fancier effect**, like:
- **Typing animation on the introduction**
- **Profile view counter**
- **Animated GIFs or other visuals**

Let me know, and I’ll help further fine-tune your GitHub profile!
